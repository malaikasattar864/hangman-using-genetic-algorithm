The game we chose is "Hangman". It is a single player guessing players. A person thinks of a word and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. For our project, we used Genetic Algorithm to make our Hangman game smarter and more intelligent. It's like teaching the game to guess words better by itself. The game went through a training process to learn how to guess letters more effectively within a certain number of tries.
